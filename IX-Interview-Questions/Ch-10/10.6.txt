Split all strings into 1 of 26 files depending on their first character.

Assuming these strings are evenly distrubted, each file should be a little
less than 1 GB. This means we can load one of these files into memory
at a time. Once we load the file, we can sort the file.

After each of the 26 files have been sorted. We can can combine them and
overwrite the original file.
