1 billion = 1,000,000,000 = 10^9
An int is 32 bits or 4 bytes

16 billion bytes = 16 GB

Separate integers into 100 different files based on their last two digits

Each file will be roughly 160 MB

Pull in the smallest file into memory and create a hash table with the
integers.

Iterate in increments of 100 until a new integer is found

-- FOLLOW UP --

Same as above, but separate integers into 10,000 different files based
on their last 4 digits

Each file will be roughly 1.6 MB

Iterate in increments of 10,000 until a new integer is found
