Questions:
- How many stocks or indices does the average client request information for?
- Who are the clients? Are they people or other systems?
- How often do the clients make requests? Are they expected to saved
    information to their own systems? Will we need to serve requests
    for data well in the past?
- What kind of security will be needed for this?

Assumptions:
- We'll need a system that can scale horizontally with the assumption that
    the number of clients will increase over time
- Although this is end-of-day data, financial data often needs to be delivered
    quickly. We will assume this data needs to be delivered quickly
- This information will need to be available as soon as markets close

Recommendations:
- The system needs to work asynchronously. While the system is fetching data
    from the database, it needs to be able to handle new client requests
- Requests and responses will use the HTTP protocol
- The system should use caching since data from more recent dates are likely
    to be more in demand than less recent dates
