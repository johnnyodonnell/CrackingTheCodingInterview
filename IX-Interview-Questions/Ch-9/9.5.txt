A cache could be stored on each of the frontend servers for super popular
search requests. A separate cluser could also store frequent searches.
This cluster would be available on the network to the frontend servers.

The data in the caches could have an expiration date. They could have their
data pushed to them. For example, the most popular searches could be
periodically pushed to the caches. Also, depending how much control we
have over the caches, we may able to fetch the fresh data directly from
the server. Finally, the frontend servers could update the caches after
making a frequest `processSearch`
