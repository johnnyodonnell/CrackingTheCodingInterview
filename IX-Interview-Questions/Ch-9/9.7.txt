Bank and financial account seems to take awhile to fetch; thus, I would cache
this data and also make periodic fetches while users are offline to keep this
cache as fresh as possible.

There is a tradeoff between keeping the cache fresh and using compute
resources. Finding the right balance between these two might be a good
problem space for machine learning.

Machine learning would be super helpeful for categorizing transactions.
In fact, it may be the only option for categorizing transacitons at scale.

Analyzing spending habits would require comparing transactions from one
time period to a previous time period of the same duration.

Recommendations can be made after there is sufficient data to analyze
transactions over time.
