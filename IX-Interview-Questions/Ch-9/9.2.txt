Relationships between profiles would be many-to-many.

If using an SQL database, a separate table representing profile relationships
could be used.

If using a NoSQL database, each profile could hold an id for profiles for
which they have a relationship with. Thus, redundant information would
need to be stored in two different areas of the database.

A BFS search starting from both the start and end nodes would be a good
solution for finding the shortest path.
