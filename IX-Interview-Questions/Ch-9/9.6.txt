I would keep a separate table with the top selling items.

Have a value that is close, but guaranteed to be slightly lower, to the
lowest selling item on the top selling item. Whenever an item sells and
its total sales exceeds this value, then queue this item for potential
insertion into the top selling items table.

The queue and insertion computation can take place on the same system
that executed the sale. Or they can be handled by other systems. In
either case they should be asynchronous and not delay the execution
of a sale.
