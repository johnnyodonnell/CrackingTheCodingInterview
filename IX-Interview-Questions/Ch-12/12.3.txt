An STL map uses a binary tree unless specified to be unordered.
An unordered STL map is essentially a Hash Table.

The number of inputs is small?
    - Small number of keys, but large number of values?
    - Large number of keys, but small number of values?
    - Small number of keys, and small number of values?

Maybe a vector? An unordered_set?
