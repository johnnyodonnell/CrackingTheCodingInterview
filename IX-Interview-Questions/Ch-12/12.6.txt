In C++, `volatile` is used when dealing with concurrent programming.
I can't remember exactly what it means, but I think it signifies that
a variable may be accessed by multiple threads. Maybe it is used
similarly in C, although I don't know much about concurrent programming
in C.

In Java, I believe `volatile` signifies that a function is non-native.
