I'm stumped on this one.

My understanding of locks is that a single class cannot guarantee a lock it
provides does not result in deadlock without knowing about all the locks
and resources in the system. Knowing about all the locks and resources
in a system is impractical. Thus, simply by providing a lock, a class
is risking deadlock.

I will defer to the solution in the book for this one.
