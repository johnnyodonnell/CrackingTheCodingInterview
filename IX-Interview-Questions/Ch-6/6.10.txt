Question:

You have 1000 bottles of soda, and exactly one is poisoned. You have 10 test
strips which can be used to detect poison. A single drop of poison will turn
the test strip positive permanently. You can put any number of drops on a
test strip at once and you can reuse a test strip as many times as you'd like
(as long as the results are negative). However, you can only run tests once
per day and it takes seven days to return a result. How would you figure out
the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?

Answer:

1  test 500
2  test 250
3  test 125
4  test 63
5  test 32
6  test 16
7  test 8
8  test 4
9  test 2
10 test 1

70 days
