Question:

You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has
pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement,
how would you find the heavy bottle?
You can only use the scale once.

Answer:

Number each bottle 1 to 20. Put a n pills from the each n-numbered bottle.

1, 9 = 10
2, 8 = 10
3, 7 = 10
4, 6 = 10
5    = 5
10   = 10

11, 19 = 30
12, 18 = 30
13, 17 = 30
14, 16 = 30
15     = 15
20     = 20

50 + 40 + 120 = 210

heavy bottle will be bottle b, where
b = (total weight - 210) / .1
