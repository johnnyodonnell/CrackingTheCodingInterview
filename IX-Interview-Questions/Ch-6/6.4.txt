Question:

There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the
probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start
walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each any randomly picks
a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen,
and that they walk at the same speed.

Similarly find the probably of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

Answer:

Total Possibilities = 3 * 2 = 6
Possibilities they all pick they same direction (left or right): 2

Probability of collision: 2 / 3

Probablity of collison for n-vertx: (n - 1) / n
