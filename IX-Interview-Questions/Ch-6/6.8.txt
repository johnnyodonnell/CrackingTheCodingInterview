Question:

There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above
it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break.
You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the
worst case.

Assumptions:

Egg can break when dropped from floor 1. In which case, N = 0.

Answer:

1 floor
- Drop egg once from floor 1
    - if it breaks, N = 0
    - if it doesn't break, N = 1
- Worst case: 1 drop

2 floors
- Can start from either floor 1 or floor 2
- Worst case: 2 drops

3 floors
- Start from floor 3
- Worst case: 3 drops

- Start from floor 2
- Worst case:  2 drops

- Start from floor 1
- Worst case: 3 drops

4 floors
- Start from floor 4
- Worst case: 4 drops

- Start from floor 3
- Worst case: 3 drops

- Start from floor 2
- Worst case: 3 drops

- Start from floor 1
- Worst case: 3 drops

5 floors
- Start from floor 3
- Worst case: 3 drops

- Start from floor 2
    - If breaks, go to floor 4
- Worst case: 3 drops

- Start from floor 1
- Worst case: 4 drops

6 floors
- Start from floor 3
- Worst Case: 3 drops

- Start from floor 2
- Worst Case: 4 drops

100 floors
- Drop every 10 floors
- Worst case: 19 drops

- Drop every 9 floors
- Worst case: 19 drops

- Drop every 8 floors
- Worst case: 19 drops

- Drop every 7 floors
- Worst case: 20 drops

- Drop every 6 floors
- Worst case: 20 drops

10, 9, or 8
