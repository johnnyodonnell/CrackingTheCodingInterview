Question:

You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two
games.

Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.

Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.

If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p
should you pick one game or the other?

Answer:

Game 1 : tp = p

Game 2 : tp = (p * p * p) + 3 * (p * p * (1 - p))

         tp = p^3 + 3 * (p^2 - p^3) = 3p^2 - 2p^3
         tp = p^2(3 - 2p)


When are both games equal?

p = 3p^2 - 2p^3
1 = 3p - 2p^2
2p^2 - 3p + 1 = 0
(2p - 1)(p - 1) = 0;



if p = 0, .5, or 1, it doesn't matter which game.

if p is between (0, .5), choose Game 1
if p is between (.5, 1), choose Game 2
