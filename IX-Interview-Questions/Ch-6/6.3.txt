Question:

There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been
cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly
two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove
your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

Answer:

2x2 board (1 domino)
- Doesn't work

3x3 board (3 dominos)
- Doesn't work
- No odd-by-odd board will work

2x4 board (3 dominos)
- Doesn't work

4x4 board (7 dominos)

8x8 (31 dominos)

It's impossible because to fill the bottom half of the 8x8, the top half
then becomes a 4x8 with the two corners removed. To fill the bottom half of
a 4x8, the top top half becomes a 2x8 with two corners removed. To fill
the bottom half of a 2x8 board, the top half will be impossible to fill.
